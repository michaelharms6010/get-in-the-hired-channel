# How to Get Into The Lambda School Hired Channel

Hey man. Honored you'd ask.

Systems are the thing. Systems. Find a good system and stick with it. Actionable stuff. Follow what gives you energy.

Sleep, diet, and exercise should be your absolute top priority. Your mental health is your full-time job during bootcamp and job search. If you're broken, you're useless. Sleep, diet, and exercise. No compromise.

Code every day. Find your niche. I was into crypto, I built crypto stuff, and I got hired by a boss who was into crypto. Build tech around whatever it is you're into.

Don't be afraid to build bad stuff. Make a shitty side project. Build it halfway and give up. Everything is going to build your skillsets, your habits, and your ability to visualize and plan out an app.

GET INTO DEVOPS. If you haven't used AWS/ec2 (or whatever other cloud provider), use them now now now. AWS has a year long free tier that gives you 1 year of 1 virtual server 100% free. Build and host a react app on there. Then build and host a react app on S3 (better and cheaper, a little more niche of a skill). Run a react/node/postgress fullstack app on your free aws box. Set up DNS stuff. **Get comfortable with linux (pref. ubuntu), nginx and certbot** to actually competently host your own fullstack services

Build apps. Nobody is gonna hire you for being a lambda grad. Nobody's gonna hire you because you were a good call center worker or barista (i was a barista). Build projects and when they're actually good, put em on the resume. When they suck, move on and be happy - every project has huge learnings.

Get used to googling and solving your own problems, it never ends and it's a real skill.

While I bigly recommend the AWS practice, but most of all, it's about systems over goals. Actionable daily tasks that increase your exposure to success.

It takes a little luck. I had to find a crypto-friendly employer who dug my side projects, and even then I had to crush the technical interview. You can't force luck. But you can do things every day that increase your exposure to potential luck. Sleep, diet, exercise, projects. Sustainable, daily habits.

Good luck man!
